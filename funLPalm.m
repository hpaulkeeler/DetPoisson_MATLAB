% function LPalm=funLPalm(L,indexPalm) 
% This function calculates the L matrix for a Palm distribution
% conditioned on points existing at locations of the statespace indexed by 
% indexPalm. The method is discussed in the paper by  Blaszczyszyn and 
% Keeler (in Section B of the appendix), which is based on Proposition 1.2
% in the paper by Borodin and Rains[1], but an equivalent result appears 
% in the paper by Shirai and Takahashi[3]; see Theorem 6.5 and 
% Corolloary 6.6 in [3].
%
% INPUTS:
% L = A square L(-matrix-)kernel, which must be (semi-)positive-definite. 
% indexPalm = an index set for the conditioned point, where all the points 
% of the underlying statespace correspond to the rows (or columns) of L.
%
% LPalm= The (reduced) Palm version of the L matrix, which is a square 
% matrix with dimension of size(L,1)-length(indexPalm).
